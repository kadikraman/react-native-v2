# [React Native v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-native-v2/)

Welcome to my React Native course! See the [course website here](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-v2/).

If you'd like to follow along with videos for the course, you can watch my [React Native v2 course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-native-v2/) on Frontend Masters.

## About the course

This course is intended for students who are new to React Native, but not new to JavaScript. Some familiarity with React is beneficial, but not essential.

## Expo or plain React Native

You will have a choice whether to follow this course using Expo or with plain React Native. I will have instructions for both. Most of the code will be the same, and I will highlight any differences. If these terms are unfamiliar to you, read/watch lessons 1 and 2 for context and then make your decision.

#### You _must_ use Expo if:

You are using Windows/Linux, but want to use an iPhone to run your app

#### I would recommend you use Expo if:

You just want to try out React Native, but don't want to spend much time on setup

#### You should use plain React Native if:

You have time and interest in setting up the native development environment (can take quite a few hours depending on your operating system and environment)
