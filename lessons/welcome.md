Hi there, and welcome to React Native v2! 👋

## Course Objective

I build React Native apps for a living and my main goal is to show you how I do it - what are the best practices, conventions, do's and don'ts.

The aim of the course is to give you the knowledge and resources necessary to start working on your own React Native project. We will cover what React Native is and how it works, what kind of components and tooling is available, and how to use them. We will stick with built-in and mainsteam components, and minimize the use of third party components.

## Course guide

The course is designed to be pretty hands-on: the general pattern is that we'll introduce a concept and then apply it.

- chapters marked with a 📝 emoji are exercises. How you approach them is up to you! If you generally learn best by doing, I'd recommend spending up to 10-15 minutes in completing the exercise independently before looking at the solution.
- there will be a link 🔗 at the end of each lesson that points to a GitHub repository with the solution. Use this as a reference to check your work.
- you will also occasionally see links with a 🔍 emoji - these are code examples in Expo Snack, which there to help introduce or illustrate a concept. You can look at these in the browser (unless specified otherwise) or on your phone if you have the Expo app installed. Feel free to play around with them, your changes will not be saved to the hosted version.
- you can follow this course with Expo or without, the choice is yours. For most lessons, this doesn't matter. There are a couple of pages that are specific to the platform though. These will be prefixed with `[Expo]` or `[RN]` - choose the one that applies to you and ignore the other.

## About You

The intended audience for this course are people who are familiar with JavaScript, but new to React Native. If you already know React, that's perfect, since your React skills are completely transferrable to React Native, with only minor modifications to account for the native platform. However if you are new to both React and Native, never fear! I will be explaining all the React concepts as well as the React Native concepts as we discover them together, however there will be more of a focus on the parts of React Native that _differ_ from React on the web.

In this course, I will be using a MacBook Pro, an iPhone simulator and an Android emulator from Android Studio.

You do not need to match my setup, but you should have:

- either a Mac, Windows or Linux machine
- either a physical device (iPhone or Android) OR a simulator/emulator installed

There are a few different ways to set up your development environment, depending on what hardware you have and whether you'd like to use vanilla React Native or Expo. Don't worry about making a decision right away, the [next lesson](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-v2/the-expo-debate) will explain the pros and cons of all your options so you can make an informed decision on what is the best fit for you.

</div>

Hi, my name is Kadi and I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/) where I build things in JavaScript, mostly using React Native. I first got into coding in University where I studied Maths with Psychology. I had just the one programming course in second year of university, in C++. From the first time my program compiled and ran without errors, I was hooked! Since then, I had a winding road to end up where I am now, but suffice it to say I have been writing code professionally since 2013, using React since 2015 and React Native since 2017.

As for social media, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kadikraman), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadi-kraman-922a7277/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kadikraman).

## Why Was This Course Created

This is supplementary material for my Frontend Masters course - [React Native v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-native-v2/) using the Gatsby template by [Brian Holt](https://github.com/btholt). Not everyone has the money to pay for these courses which is why these materials are and will be forever open source for you to reference and share. Thank you to the kind people at Frontend Masters who are encouraging teachers to compile and open source these course materials.
