Similarly to how we’ve yet to invent a completely impenetrable lock (bank vaults do, after all, still get broken into), it is also almost impossible to build software to be completely impenetrable. However, the probability of falling victim to a malicious attack or being exposed for a security vulnerability is inversely proportional to the effort you’re willing to put in to protecting your application against any such eventuality. Although an ordinary padlock is pickable, it is still much harder to get past than a cabinet hook!</p>\n<p>In this guide, you will learn about best practices for storing sensitive information, authentication, network security, and tool that will help you secure your application.

Anything included in your code could be accessed in plain text by anyone inspecting the app bundle. Tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config/\">react-native-config</a> are great for adding environment-specific variables like API endpoints, but they should not be confused with server-side environment variables, which can often contain secrets and api keys.</p>\n<p>If you must have an API key or a secret to access some resource from your app, the most secure way to handle this would be to build an orchestration layer between your app and the resource. This could be a serverless function (e.g. using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions) which can forward the request with the required API key or secret. Secrets in server side code cannot be accessed by the API consumers the same way secrets in your app code can.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Persisted vs unpersisted</strong> — persisted data is written to the device’s memory, which lets the data be read by your app across application launches without having to do another network request to fetch it or asking the user to re-enter it. But this also can make that data more vulnerable to being accessed by attackers. Unpersisted data is never written to memory—so there's no data to access!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>For persisted user data, choose the right type of storage based on its sensitivity.</strong> As your app is used, you’ll often find the need to save data on the device, whether to support your app being used offline, cut down on network requests or save your user’s access token between sessions so they wouldn’t have to re-authenticate each time they use the app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"async-storage\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#async-storage\" aria-label=\"async storage permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Async Storage</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage\">Async Storage</a> is a community-maintained module for React Native that provides an asynchronous, unencrypted, key-value store.

Deep linking is a way of sending data directly to a native application from an outside source. A deep link looks like <code class=\"language-text\">app://</code> where <code class=\"language-text\">app</code> is your app scheme and anything following the // could be used internally to handle the request.</p>\n<p>For example, if you were building an ecommerce app, you could use <code class=\"language-text\">app://products/1</code> to deep link to your app and open the product detail page for a product with id 1. You can think of these kind of like URLs on the web, but with one crucial distinction:</p>\n<p>Deep links are not secure and you should never send any sensitive information in them.</p>\n<p>The reason deep links are not secure is because there is no centralized method of registering URL schemes. As an application developer, you can use almost any url scheme you choose by <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app\">configuring it in Xcode</a> for iOS or <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking\">adding an intent on Android</a>.</p>\n<p>There is nothing stopping a malicious application from hijacking your deep link by also registering to the same scheme and then obtaining access to the data your link contains. Sending something like <code class=\"language-text\">app://products/1</code> is not harmful, but sending tokens is a security concern.</p>\n<p>When the operating system has two or more applications to choose from when opening a link, Android will show the user a modal and ask them to choose which application to use to open the link. On iOS however, the operating system will make the choice for you, so the user will be blissfully unaware. Apple has made steps to address this issue in later iOS versions (iOS 11) where the instituted a first-come-first-served principle, although this vulnerability could still be exploited in different ways which you can read more about <a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/ios-url-scheme-susceptible-to-hijacking/\">here</a>.

The OpenID Connect protocol is also based on this. In OAuth2, the user is asked to authenticate via a third party. On successful completion, this third party redirects back to the requesting application with a verification code which can be exchanged for a JWT — a <a href=\"https://jwt.io/introduction/\">JSON Web Token</a>. JWT is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties on the web.</p>\n<p>On the web, this redirect step is secure, because URLs on the web are guaranteed to be unique. This is not true for apps because, as mentioned earlier, there is no centralized method of registering URL schemes! In order to address this security concern, an additional check must be added in the form of PKCE.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://oauth.net/2/pkce/\">PKCE</a>, pronounced “Pixy” stands for Proof of Key Code Exchange, and is an extension to the OAuth 2 spec. This involves adding an additional layer of security which verifies that the authentication and token exchange requests come from the same client. PKCE uses the <a href=\"https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html\">SHA 265</a> Cryptographic Hash Algorithm. SHA 265 creates a unique “signature” for a text or file of any size, but it is</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always the same length regardless of the input file</li>\n<li>Guaranteed to be always produce the same result for the same input</li>\n<li>One way (that is, you can’t reverse engineer it to reveal the original input)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now you have two values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>code_verifier</strong> - a large random string generated by the client</li>\n<li><strong>code_challenge</strong> - the SHA 265 of the code_verifier</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During the initial <code class=\"language-text\">/authorize</code> request, the client also sends the <code class=\"language-text\">code_challenge</code> for the <code class=\"language-text\">code_verifier</code> it keeps in memory. After the authorize request has returned correctly, the client also sends the <code class=\"language-text\">code_verifier</code> that was used to generate the <code class=\"language-text\">code_challenge</code>. The IDP will then calculate the <code class=\"language-text\">code_challenge</code>, see if it matches what was set on the very first <code class=\"language-text\">/authorize</code> request, and only send the access token if the values match.</p>\n<p>This guarantees that only the application that triggered the initial authorization flow would be able to successfully exchange the verification code for a JWT. So even if a malicious application gets access to the verification code, it will be useless on its own. To see this in action, check out <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/#mobile-apps\">this example</a>.</p>\n<p>A library to consider for native OAuth is <a href=\"https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-app-auth\">react-native-app-auth</a> - an SDK for communicating with OAuth2 providers. It wraps the native <a href=\"https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS\">AppAuth-iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android\">AppAuth-Android</a> libraries and supports PKCE, (but only if your Identity Provider supports it)!</p>\n<h2 id=\"network-security\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#network-security\" aria-label=\"network security permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Network Security</h2>\n<p>Your APIs should always use <a href=\"https://www.ssl.com/faqs/faq-what-is-ssl/\">SSL encryption</a>.

With https, the client will only trust the server if it can provide a valid certificate that is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority that is pre-installed on the client. An attacker could take advantage of this by installing a malicious root CA certificate to the user’s device, so the client would trust all certificates that are signed by the attacker. Thus, relying on certificates alone could still leave you vulnerable to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">man-in-the-middle attack</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>SSL pinning</strong> is a technique that can be used on the client side to avoid this attack. It works by embedding (or pinning) a list of trusted certificates to the client during development, so that only the requests signed with one of the trusted certificates will be accepted, and any self-signed certificates will not be.</p>\n<p>When using SSL pinning, you should be mindful of certificate expiry. Certificates expire every 1-2 years and when one does, it’ll need to be updated in the app as well as on the server.

And remember: it’s significantly harder to access information that was never requested in the first place.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/security","title":"Security","order":32}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":0,"path":"/intro","title":"Welcome"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":1,"path":"/react-native","title":"About React Native"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":2,"path":"/the-expo-debate","title":"Should you use Expo or plain React Native?"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":3,"path":"/setup-expo","title":"[Expo] Getting started with Expo"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":4,"path":"/setup-rn","title":"[RN] Getting started with plain React Native"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":5,"path":"/code-style","title":"Adding a linter"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":6,"path":"/debugging","title":"Debugging"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":7,"path":"/intro-to-react","title":"Basic React Native components"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":8,"path":"/styling","title":"Styling"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":9,"path":"/styling-exercise","title":"Styling Exercise 📝"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":10,"path":"/styling-exercise-solution","title":"Styling Exercise Solution 👀"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":11,"path":"/components","title":"Components"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":12,"path":"/lists","title":"Lists"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":13,"path":"/lists-exercise","title":"Lists Exercise 📝"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":14,"path":"/lists-exercise-solution","title":"Lists Exercise Solution 👀"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":15,"path":"/navigation-intro","title":"Navigation Into"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":16,"path":"/navigation-expo","title":"[Expo] Adding navigation with Expo"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":17,"path":"/navigation-rn","title":"[RN] Adding navigation with plain React Native"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":18,"path":"/adding-navigation","title":"Adding Navigation"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":19,"path":"/navigation-exercise","title":"Navigation Exercise 📝"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":20,"path":"/navigation-exercise-solution","title":"Navigation Exercise Solution 👀"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":21,"path":"/react-hooks","title":"useState, useCallback, useEffect"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":22,"path":"/network-requests-exercise","title":"Network Requests Exercise 📝"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":23,"path":"/network-requests-exercise-solution","title":"Network Requests Exercise Solution 👀"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":24,"path":"/pull-to-refresh","title":"Pull to refresh"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":25,"path":"/forms","title":"Overview of Forms in React Native"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":26,"path":"/modals","title":"Opening a full screen modal"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":27,"path":"/forms-exercise","title":"Form exercise 📝"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":28,"path":"/forms-exercise-solution","title":"Form exercise solution 👀"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":29,"path":"/wrapping-up","title":"Wrapping up"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":30,"path":"/ejecting-from-expo","title":"[Expo] Ejecting from Expo"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":31,"path":"/platform-specific-code","title":"Platform Specific Code"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":32,"path":"/security","title":"Security"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
